## Welcome to Operation COVID-19

Our aim is to track, mobilise and prevent the spread of Coronavirus-19 to save lives and improve global public health systems.

### How we are doing this is by:
- Creating a questionnaire to help track more cases of untested COVID-19 to reveal the scale of the problem, 
- Collect insights from people who have contracted COVID-19 to provide back to the medical, public health and government to build body of knowledge to find a vaccine 
- Create a map visualiation of official and self-reported COVID-19 cases, recovered, deaths to support best practices globally including more testing
- Support accurate and credible sources of information to combat fake news and spread of misinformation 
- Mobilise GitHub open-source community to contribute to fight this epidemic.
